**Welcome to the AVIV front-end test.**

This test will assess your skills when working with React. To get started, please read this document carefully, before starting working on the project.

> **⚠️ Heads up!**
> 
> Make sure you have carefully read the [main README file](../README.md) before continuing. It contains _critical_ instructions regarding expectations and test completion.

# Objectives

The aim of this project is to provide in a React application made of two different pages:

- A page that will provide a list of the available listings, with a form to create new ones;
- A page that provides the history of a specific listing.

To achieve this, you will need to complete three objectives.

## Objective 1: New listing form

We want the main page to include a form that allows the user to create a new listing. Your objective is to implement that form so new listings are stored in the API when submitted.

## Objective 2: Listings Page

We want the main page to provide a list of cards, each card representing a listing. The user should be able to click a card to go to a sub-page that will display the price history of the selected listing.

An [example](./src/containers/Listings/Listings.tsx) of a card is provided along the test for which you have a preview [here](./assets/listing-card.png).

## Objective 3: Listing price history page

This sub-page should load and display a simple list of the price history for a specific listing.
The sub-page should be accessible through the url `/:listingId/prices`.

> **ℹ️ Styles and CSS**
> 
> The CSS styling is already provided and **we do not expect you to focus particularly on that part**. The CSS is built on
[BEM](https://getbem.com/introduction/) principles and can be found in the file [`src/styles/global.scss`](./src/styles/global.scss).

# Running the project

A bootstrapped project is provided to you with React and some dependencies so you can start working directly without the headache of configuring the project.

## Browsing the API

You will need to interact with an API when implementing your front-end. Because we are running in a GitHub Codespace, you will have to use the `BACKEND_API_HOST` environment variable instead of `localhost` to connect to this backend. The API is already running. Here is an example command to get the list of listings:

```sh
echo https://${BACKEND_API_HOST}/listings
curl https://${BACKEND_API_HOST}/listings
```

This API is described by an OpenAPI specification. You can open and view this specification in ReDoc by using the terminal and running the following command:

```sh
echo ${REDOC_URL}
```

Click on the displayed URL and browse the documentation to understand how the API works.

## Beggining development

You can start developing by running the following command, and reading the warning carrefuly:

```sh
npm run dev
```

> **⚠️ How can I access my development server?**
> 
> The output displays that the development servers is running on `localhost`. Of course, because you are using a GitHub Codespace, you cannot access this url directly, because it would point to your local machine. However, if you `ctrl`+`click` on it, GitHub Codespace will automatically substitute `localhost` so it points to the cloud running instance. You can see all running services in the `PORTS` tab on the bottom panel of this IDE.

To run the tests, you can use:

```sh
npm run test
```

If you need to install additional dependencies, you can of course use the usual `npm` commands.

**Good luck**, and do not forget to read again the [main README file](../README.md) to ensure you did not forget anything when you think you're done!
