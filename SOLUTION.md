# AVIV technical test solution

You can use this file to write down your assumptions and list the missing features or technical revamp that should
be achieved with your implementation.

## Notes
[//]: # (TODO: write down assumption or not developed parts)
- prices should be stored in long/decimal + maybe with currency

- need to add pagination
- idempotency for updates ?
- security
    - authorization ?
    - ddos prevention
    - ...?
- monitoring, logging
- observability ???

## Questions

This section contains additional questions your expected to answer before the debrief interview.

- **What is missing with your implementation to go to production?**

- **How would you deploy your implementation?**

- **If you had to implement the same application from scratch, what would you do differently?**

- **The application aims at storing hundreds of thousands listings and millions of prices, and be accessed by millions
  of users every month. What should be anticipated and done to handle it?**

  NB: You must update the [given architecture schema](./schemas/Aviv_Technical_Test_Architecture.drawio) by importing it
  on [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/)
