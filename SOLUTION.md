# AVIV technical test solution

You can use this file to write down your assumptions and list the missing features or technical revamp that should
be achieved with your implementation.

## Notes

Write here notes about your implementation choices and assumptions.

## Questions

This section contains additional questions your expected to answer before the debrief interview.

- **What is missing with your implementation to go to production?**

- **How would you deploy your implementation?**

- **If you had to implement the same application from scratch, what would you do differently?**

- **The application aims at storing hundreds of thousands listings and millions of prices, and be accessed by millions
  of users every month. What should be anticipated and done to handle it?**

## When you're done

Send us a `.zip` file with commits history (keep the `.git` folder). The file should include
- the `.git/` folder;
- the entire codebase;
- this SOLUTION.md file, with the answers to the questions written above.

If you want to join any additional file, you can add them to the archive and link them here.
